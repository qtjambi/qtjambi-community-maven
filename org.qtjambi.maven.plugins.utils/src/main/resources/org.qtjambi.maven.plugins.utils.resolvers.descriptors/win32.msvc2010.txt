# FIXME: This isn't currently used, but describes the necessary environment changes
#  needed to perform building from Java without presuming vcvars32.bat is run first.
# @NoValidatePath - Don't check if the path we are adding exists (may wish to warn
#  by default when adding paths that don't exist, this can help spot obvious problems).
# @EnvNoExport - Keep this internally, don't export value to child process, this
#  also means we MUST always resolve the value before starting the child process.
# @EnvExport - Export this to child process
# @EnvPathAppend - Items below are in PATH separated syntax, so append to any existing
#  envvar using the platform scheme (or create variable if it does not exist).
# @EnvSet - Overwrite the value exactly (this is the default)
# @EnvPathAppendMargeUnique - like @EndPathAppend except if an individual element
#  already exists don't append it again.
